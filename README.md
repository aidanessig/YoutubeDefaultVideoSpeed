## Google Chrome Extension to Set a Default Youtube Video Speed

### How to Use:

To use the extension, once on a Youtube video, click the extension icon. In the panel, you will see the option to select speed. Select the default speed that you want played each time the video is loaded and click 'Save'.

You will see the page change to reflect this new speed. 

When on a video that has a saved speed, this is shown in the bottom of the panel. This can be turned off with the 'Remove' button or can also clear all saved data with 'Clear All Data'
