## Google Chrome Extension to Set a Default Youtube Video Speed

### How to Use:

To use the extension, once on a Youtube video, click the extension icon. In the panel, you will see the option to select speed. Select the default speed that you want each time the video is loaded and click 'Save'. If you want this speed to be applied to all videos of the current video's channels, click the check mark. 

You will see the page change to reflect this new speed and this video or channel added to the saved list. 

When on a video that has a saved speed, this is shown in the bottom of the panel. This save can be turned off with the 'Remove' button or can also clear all saved data with 'Remove All Data'.

### Running Locally

Clone the repository locally:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:aidanessig/YoutubeDefaultVideoSpeed.git
```
In your chrome browser, navigate to *[chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions)*. In the top right, toggle developer mode. Click on **Load unpacked** in top left and select the directory with the extension. You will see it appear in the extensions list.
